Some uses:

* The input.nml do not require any order, so it is usually not fun to compare two different input.nml. This command is different then a regular diff, since it doesn't care abour the order of the variables. The output show what is different, or what is present in only one of the files.

    mom4_namelist compare input.nml input2.nml
